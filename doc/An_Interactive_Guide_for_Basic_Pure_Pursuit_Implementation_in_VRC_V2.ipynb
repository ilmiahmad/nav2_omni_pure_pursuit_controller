        "\n",
        "The pure pursuit controller is an automatic steering method for wheeled mobile robots. It is a steering method, which means it computes the necessary augular velocity for a wheeled robot to stay on pre-computed paths. Linear velocity is assumed to be constant. Therefore, an additional velocity controller of your choice is needed if you wish to slow down the robot as it aproaches the target (something as simple as a proportional controller could work). During the 2020-2021 VRC season, our team used the pure pursuit controller for the programming skills challenge and acheived great results. Videos of our robot in action can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KE7NF-hdAeA).\n",

There is another solid green line connecting the point the robot is \"chasing after\" and the robot's current position, but it's very hard to see in this demo. Although the robot's trajectory does not match with the path perfectly, the pure pursuit controller still performed decently well.\n",

Then, the goal point is used to calculate the appropiate angular velocity needed for the robot to move toward that point. As the robot moves forward, a different goal point on the path will be selected and the robot's angular velocity will be updated. Since the robot can never reach this goal point and the goal point stays on the path, the end result would be the robot tracing the path.\n",

In our application, the circle would be centered at the robot's current position `[currentX, currentY]` and the two points that define the line would be arbitrary points `pt1 = [x1, y1]` and `pt2 = [x2, y2]`. Therefore, to apply this method, we first need to subtract `currentX` and `currentY` from `[x1, y1]` and `[x2, y2]` to center the system at origin. Again, we perform such offsets so that we can use the method from the screenshot above, which requires the circle to be centered at the origin.\n",

One method we can use is to calculate the distance between the intersections and the second point `(x2, y2)`(the path goes in the direction of `(x1, y1) -> (x2, y2)`) and pick the point that is closer to the second point (in other words, the point closer to the end of the path).\n",

        "* In some extreme cases where the robot is traveling through sharp corners, it might create multiple intersections with multiple line segments (as shown in the picture below). We can code our program in a way that the robot would follow the first valid point it found. This way, in extreme cases where the path overlaps itself or there exists multiple sharp corners, the robot would not skip a portion of the path altogether. In order to prevent the robot from going backwards in the path, we can create a variable `lastFoundIndex` to store the index of the point it just passed. Every time the loop runs, it will only check the points that are located after `path[lastFoundIndex]`. This way, **the segments the robot has already traveled through will not be checked again for intersections**. In the cases that no new intersection has been found (robot deviates from the path), the robot will follow the point at `lastFoundIndex`.\n",

        "Let's take a closer look at how `lastFoundIndex` and the goal point choosing function should work.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the robot first entered the path (the 1st loop iteration), `lastFoundIndex = 0`. The line-circle intersection search starts from `path[0]`, an intersection is found and selected as the goal point for the robot to move toward.\n",

        "\n",
        "At the end of the 1st loop iteration, `lastFoundIndex` is updated to 0 since the goal point was found in between `path[0]` and `path[1]`. When the 2nd loop iteration starts, the robot has moved closer to `path[1]`. Since `lastFoundIndex` is still 0, the line-circle intersection starts from `path[0]` again. This time, there are two intersections with the path: one located in between `path[0]` and `path[1]` and the other located in between `path[1]` and `path[2]`.\n",

        "Following normal precedure, the algorithm would choose the intersection in between `path[0]` and `path[1]` as the goal point and breaks out of the search loop. As we can tell from the picture below, it's not a very good choice since it will cause the robot to go backward. To avoid such bad goal point choice, we can add an additional condition to evaluate the goal point found by the algorithm: **the search loop break statement can only be reached if the distance between the goal point chosen and the next point in path is shorter than the distance between the robot's current position and the next point in path**. If the above statement is not true, the search loop continues. We can also increment `lastFoundIndex` in case the robot fails to find intersections in the next line segment. This will prevent the robot from going backward since `path[lastFoundIndex]` will become the goal point when no intersection can be found.\n",
        "\n",
        "Equivalent pseudo code:\n",
        "```\n",

        "else:\n",
        "  lastFoundIndex += 1\n",
        "  continue\n",
        "```\n",
        "In the situation illustrated below, it is obvious that the distance between the `goalPt` (the left intersection) and `path[1]` is greater that the distance between `currentPos` and `path[1]` (both distance are marked with dotted red line).

        "## **Move Toward Target Point - Part 1**\n",
        "Now that we have a goal point determined, the next step would be to make the robot move toward that point. Let's first look at how to move the robot to a fixed target point. Consider the situation illustrated below, where the robot is located at `[currentX, currentY]` and we would like to make it move to point `[targetX, targetY]`:\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src = \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1ociR_xW63HVZOWwKkMlkcmQ4Neqf7uUf\" width = '600'>\n",
        "\n",
        "The robot would need to perform two actions at the same time: moving toward the target point and turning toward the target point. To achieve this, we need to calculate linear and turn velocity separatly and add them together to obtain the final speed. Obtaining linear error is easy in this case. In the picture above, the total distance the robot needs to travel is marked with the dotted gray line and have value `sqrt(pow(targetY - currentY, 2) + pow(targetX - currentX, 2))`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Obtaining turn error, however, is slightly more complicated.\n",
        "The total amount the robot needs to turn is marked in blue. Since the direction of the turn is counterclockwise, the blue angle (which would be refered to as `turnError` from this point on) should be positive. We can obtain the magnitude of this angle by performing subtraction:\n",
        "\n",
        "<img src = \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1HqgG4m42FBV-uqGomamqiwJf5tm0bvPW\" width = '600'>\n",
        "\n",
        "The `turnError` can be calculated by subtracting the orange angle (which is just `currentHeading`) from the grey angle, which is the angle vector `[targetX-currentX, targetY-currentY]` makes with the global X axis. From this point on, we will call this grey angle `absTargetAngle`. We can use the built-in `atan2` function to calculate its value. Since `atan2`'s output ranges from -180 to 180 but our cartisian coordinate system's range is 0 to 360, we can simply add 360 to the `atan2` output if its negative.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we move on, there are some special cases that are worth mentioning. If `currentHeading` is 1 degrees while `absTargetAngle` is 359 degrees, we would get `turnError = absTargetHeading - currentHeading = 1 - 359 = -358 deg`, which is totally nonsense. To make the function as efficient as possible, the robot should just turn to the target from another directon if `abs(turnError)` turns out to be greater than 180 degrees.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code cells below is a space for you to write a `find_min_angle` function that computes the minimum turn error the robot would need to turn toward the target point. If your implementation is correct, the angle returned should stay in the range of `[-180, 180]` under all circumstances. If you are more familiar with using `rotation` and modulo (%) instead of `heading`, feel free to implement the function that way. The animation function provided in later sections uses `heading` by default, but code that's compatible with `rotation` and modulo will also be provided.\n"

        "With the linear error and the turn error obtained, we can calculate the robot's left and right side velocity based on those. Since the turn error is positive when the robot turns counterclockwise, the left side should have velocity `linearVel - turnVel` and the right side should have velocity `linearVel + turnVel`. In the code example below, a basic proportional controller is used to compute these two velocities. Please note that the animation code assumes `linearVel` and `turnVel` are in `velocityUnits::pct`.\n",

        "It is natural to think that the pure pursuit controller is essentially just repeatedly moving toward target points that reside on the path, but with the linear error set to length of the remaining path. From our past experience, this basic implementation worked decently well for VRC. The original pure pursuit controller, which is used for bicycle model vehicles, calculates angular velocity in a slightly different and more complicated way. It's adaptation to differential drive robots will be briefly discussed in the next section. Before combining all the steps together, let's quickly recap what those components are:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Line-circle intersection with bounds\n",
        "* Goal point search and selection\n",
        "* Find the appropiate turn error and compute the turn velocity\n",
        "\n",
        "You might be wondering where are calculating the linear (forward) velocity. The answer is: it can be anything. The linear velocity of the robot can be computed separately with a controller of your choice. You can make it constant, proportional to the remaining distance in the path, or apply some fancy algorithms to it. As mentioned earlier, the pure pursuit controller is an automatic steering controller that outputs appropriate angular velocities.\n",
        "\n",
        "One parameter that greatly affects the controller's performance is the look ahead distance $l_d$. You might think that the smaller this distance is the better, but small look ahead distance are prone to more oscillations. On the other hand, large look ahead distance often creates the problem of \"cutting corners\". From experience, I have found that typical look ahead distance ranges from 0.7 ft to 1.5 ft for a VRC robot. I would suggest try not to set the look ahead distance below 0.5 ft. Although the simulation might look more perfect, in real world the robot will not be able to function well with look ahead distance as short as 0.5 ft.\n",

        "<img src = \"https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1R2-KlXBMu6CPy4nZ9FWjVUBkylYhPmxU\" width = '500'>\n",
        "\n",
        "The code cell below can be used for implementing the complete algorithm yourself. The sample path provided is a closed loop, so constant longitudinal velocity will work just fine with this path. You are encouraged to try out different control laws and different paths. For paths that are not a closed loop, you'll need to think about how to make the robot stop properly at the end of the path. There are many ways to accomplish this and it will be left for the readers to figure out."

        "As mentioned above, the original pure pursuit controller calculates angular velocity in a different way. The robot is expected to travel an arc that intersects both its current position and the goal point, with an additional constraint that the arc has to be tangent to the line connecting the front and back wheel of the robot. During the process of traveling this arc, the robot's angular velocity stays constant. In our implementation above, for the robot to reach the goal point, its angular velocity changes as turn error changes. The difference is illustrated in the picture below:\n",

Snider is highly recommended. There are many interesting variations (and improvements) of the pure pursuit controller out there if you search on Google Scholar."
